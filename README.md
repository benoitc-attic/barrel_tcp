# barrel

barrel is a **generic TCP acceptor pool** with low latency in Erlang.

**Main Features**:

- start/stop TCP and SSL listener
- can be use with different transports based on an "accept" model. (can
be stcp, uTCP...)
- Low latency when accepting connection
- Any protocol can be used, can be HTTP, IRC or anything you want.
- Graceful reload of protocol configurations
- Scale the number of concurrent connections accepted at the same time
- Scale the number of concurrent connections handled by a listener

## Design

> The design of barrel differs from
> [ranch](http://github.com/extend/ranch). Instead of spawning
> a new handler for each request, then making it control the socket - which
> can be slow - barrel spawns new acceptors. The accepted
> socket will continue to be used in the same process that accepted it
> previously. Optionally you can launch a process to handle the
> accepted socket if you want. The choice is yours.

## Usage

### Create a simple TCP echo server.

1. Create a simple echo handler

```
-module(echo_handler).

-export([init/3]).

init(_ListenerRef, Transport, Socket, _Opts) ->
    wait_request(Transport, Socket).

wait_request(Transport, Socket) ->
    case  Transport:recv(Socket, 0, 5000) of
        {ok, <<".\r\n">>} ->
            io:format("remote exited", []),
            Transport:close(Socket);
        {ok, Data} ->
            io:format("got ~p~n", [Data]),
            Transport:send(Socket, Data),
            wait_request(Transport, Socket);
        {error, _Reason} ->
            Transport:close(Socket)
    end.
```

`init/4` is the function that receives the transport (`barrel_tcp` if TCP or
`barrel_ssl` if SSL) socket.

Note that, by default, barrel uses the process accepting
the connection to handle the request. In other words, the acceptor process
becomes the request process. In the other case you may want to launch a new
process instead and pass the control of the socket to it (which is the
only way to do it in ranch). In this case instead of `init/4` use a
`start_link/4` function. Eg. :

```
start_link(Ref, Transport, Socket, _Opts) ->
    Pid = spawn_link(?MODULE, init, [Ref, Transport, Socket]),
    {ok, Pid}.

init(Ref, Transport, Socket) ->
    ok = barrel:accept_ack(Ref),
    wait_request(Transport, Socket).

    ...
```

To start the listener do the following:

```
Ref = echo,
NbAcceptors = 100,
Transport = barrel_tcp,
TransporOptions =  [{port, 10001}],
Protocol = echo_handler,
ProtocolOptions = [],
barrel:start_listener(Ref, NbAcceptors, Transport, TransportOptions,
                      Protocol, ProtocolOptions).
```

A Ref can be any Erlang term used to identify a listener. A listener is
a gen_server that manages all the acceptors workers and handles connection
shutdowns.

A `Protocol` is the protocol used to handle a connection. It can be any
module following the protocol behaviour. Currently Barrel handles the TCP
(`barel_tcp`) and SSL/TLS (`barel_ssl`) protocols.

A `Protocol` is what will be used to handle the data coming from the
socket. You can pass `ProtocolOpts` to it.

Additionaly you can pass custom options to the listener. This is where
you pass the SSL options, for example.

The full example can be found in the [example folder](http://github.com/benoitc/barrel/tree/master/example/echo).

### Scale

#### Number of acceptors

There are 2 ways of scaling a listener in barrel. One is to
increase the number of acceptors. By default the the number of acceptors
is 100.

To do it use the `barrel:set_nb_acceptors/2` function.

Increasing the number of acceptors will increase the number of
concurrent connections you can **accept** at the same time

### Number of clients

While increasing the number of acceptors increase the number of
concurrent connections you **accept** at the same time; you can also fix
the number of concurrent conncections (clients) you are willing to handle.
This can be used to limit the usage of the resources (memory and
file descriptors).

To do it use the `barrel:set_max_client/2` function.

### Load a new protocol configuration

Barrel allows you to either change the protocol handler or its
configuration without closing the active connections.

What happens here is that once you pass a new protocol configuration
using the function `barrel:set_protocol_conf/4` to the
listener, new acceptors will be launched with the new configuration and
old acceptors will get killed right after. Once it's done, a graceful
shutdown will be sent to the remaining connections. If the graceful timeout is
not defined, the connections will continue to run until they die, otherwise
the connections will get killed after that time passes. This behaviour is
similar to the one you can find in
[nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/CommandLine#Loading_a_New_Configuration_Using_Signals).

### Notes for developers

If you want to contribute patches or improve the docs, you will need to
build Barrel using the `rebar_dev.config`  file. It can also be built
using the **Makefile**:

```
$ make dev ; # compile & get deps
$ make devclean ; # clean all files
```
